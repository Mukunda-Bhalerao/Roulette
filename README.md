# ROULETTE - A VB.NET Game

## Description

This project is a simple graphical Roulette game created using Visual Basic (.NET 6.0) and Windows Forms. It provides a visual representation of a roulette table where players can place various types of bets and try their luck to win. The game calculates the outcome randomly and notifies the user of wins or losses.

## Features

* **Interactive Betting Board:** A visual layout with 36 numbers, colored red and black, allows for easy bet placement.
* **Random Number Generation:** The winning number is selected randomly between 1 and 36.
* **Multiple Bet Types:** Players can choose from several betting options:
    1.  **Sure Number:** Bet on a single, specific number for the highest payout.
    2.  **Dozens:** Bet on a block of twelve numbers (1-12, 13-24, or 25-36).
    3.  **Even or Odd:** Bet on whether the winning number will be even or odd.
    4.  **Red or Black:** Bet on the color of the winning number.
* **Win/Loss Notifications:** The game displays pop-up messages to inform the player of the outcome.
* **Simple UI:** Includes "Start" and "Restart" buttons for easy game control.

## How to Play

1.  **Choose Your Bet Type:**
    * Look at the list of betting options on the left side of the screen.
    * Enter the corresponding number for your choice into the "Enter Your Choice" text box. For example, enter `1` to bet on a "Sure Number".

2.  **Place Your Bet:**
    * **For "Sure Number", "Even/Odd", or "Red/Black" bets:** Enter the number (1-36) or the word ("Even", "Odd", "Red", "Black") into the "Place a Bet" text box.
    * **For "Dozens" bets:** You do not need to enter anything in the "Place a Bet" box, as your choice already specifies the number range.

3.  **Enter Bet Amount:**
    * Type the amount you wish to wager into the "Enter Bet Amount" text box. (Note: The current logic for calculating winnings is commented out but can be implemented).

4.  **Start the Game:**
    * Click the **Start** button.
    * The game will generate a random number, which will appear in the "Result" box.
    * The corresponding number on the board will turn green.
    * A message box will pop up to tell you if you've won or lost.

5.  **Restart:**
    * Click the **Restart** button to clear all fields and reset the board for a new game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A Windows operating system.
* .NET 6.0 or later installed on your machine.
* An IDE like Visual Studio to open and run the `.vbproj` file.

### Running the Application

1.  Open the `ROULETTE.vbproj` file in Visual Studio.
2.  Press `F5` or click the "Start" button in the IDE to build and run the project.

## Project Files

* **`Form1.vb`**: Contains the main logic for the game, including button clicks, bet evaluation, and win/loss conditions.

* **`Form1.resx`**: An XML-based resource file that stores assets like images and strings used by `Form1`.
* **`ROULETTE.vbproj`**: The Visual Basic project file. It contains settings, framework information, and a list of all files included in the project.
* **`ApplicationEvents.vb`**: Handles application-level events like startup, shutdown, and unhandled exceptions.
* **`ROULETTE.vbproj.user`**: Stores user-specific project settings, such as build configurations.
